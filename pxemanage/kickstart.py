kickstart submodule

Contents
--------

The ks, or kickstart files, are served by the apache web server (for
some reason, I wonder why original design just didn't use tftp for
serving all files for the boot?)

This submodule contains functions for creating and maintaining the
kickstart files.

The main file is a file named 'user-data'.  We are using cloud-init
autoinstall user data files for our pxelinux boots.  Basically the
user-data file can be set up with all the information to install a
nodes operating system without intervention.  Some cluster nodes
basically have the same hardware/os configuration, and they can all
share a profile.  For example, usually all compute nodes in a cluster
have the same hardware profile.  The only difference in the
'user-data' file for these machines is the hostname and ip address.
But there are usually a set of 3 or 4 basic hardware profiles.  We
maintain a separate directory of profiles, which are used as jinga
templates to create the specific 'user-data' file for a new host,
filling in any parameter specific to the host.
