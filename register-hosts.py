"""This script is a command line tool that is used to register
new cloudstack hosts.  This script manages dhcpd and tftpd
resources to detect new dhcp requests, register the hosts
by adding them into the dhcp services, then set the hosts
up to perform a autoinstall network boot.

This script needs to modify root configuration files and
start and stop root services, it uses sudo privilage
escalation where needed.  The user it is run as
needs to have sudo privileges on the host to successfully
run this script.
